    access all the other virtual machines or Cisco UC applications like
    Cisco UCM, CUBE, etc., to complete the lab tasks.

    connection or via a **WebRDP connection** (option B) from your
    classroom laptop.

    **Option (A) -- \[Preferred\]**
    
    To connect to the Workstation using your **local RDP connection**,
    first, you need to connect to your lab session via a VPN. Open **Cisco
    AnyConnect** on your laptop. It will prompt you for the **Host
    Address**, **username,** and **password** information for your
    session. You will find all these details under the **Info** \ 
    **AnyConnect** **Credentials** section of your lab. Enter all the
    details as shown below and click **OK** to connect to your session.
    The **Host Address**, **username,** and **password** will be different
